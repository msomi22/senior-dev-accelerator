# GitHub Issue Authoring Guidelines

Use this guide when creating GitHub issues for Senior Dev Accelerator. The goal is to make each issue clear enough for a human contributor or coding agent to research, implement, validate, and review safely.

Senior Dev Accelerator issues often touch learning content, production visibility, topic manifests, visual walkthroughs, dashboard/progress surfaces, and mobile-first UI behavior. Issues should protect those standards instead of giving vague tasks.

## Why issues matter in this repo

A good issue should:

- explain the learner or maintainer outcome;
- link small tasks to epics where possible;
- point implementers to the right docs and files;
- prevent unrelated refactors;
- protect production-visible content quality;
- make validation expectations clear;
- be ready for both humans and coding agents.

## Research before creating an issue

Before opening an issue, check:

- [ ] open issues for duplicates;
- [ ] closed issues for completed or rejected work;
- [ ] related PRs for implementation history;
- [ ] relevant docs under `docs/`;
- [ ] likely source files when behavior already exists;
- [ ] whether the work belongs under an existing epic;
- [ ] whether the task should be split into child issues.

Useful project references:

- `docs/writing-coding-implementation-instructions.md`
- `docs/adding-new-problems.md`
- `docs/problem-authoring.md`
- `docs/visual-schema.md`
- `docs/content-quality-rubric.md`
- `docs/production-question-audit.md`
- `README.md`

Useful GitHub references:

- About issues: `https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/learning-about-issues/about-issues`
- Managing labels: `https://docs.github.com/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/managing-labels`
- Configuring issue templates: `https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-issue-templates-for-your-repository`

## Choose the issue type

| Type | Use when | Typical labels |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Epic | Work is large and should be split into child issues. | `epic`, plus area labels |
| Feature | Adds user-facing capability or meaningful behavior. | `feature`, `enhancement` |
| Bug | Fixes unintended behavior, broken UI, incorrect counts, routing issues, or regressions. | `bug`, plus area labels |
| Documentation | Creates or improves docs, guides, or repository instructions. | `documentation` |
| Content | Adds or improves learning content, problem files, explanations, metadata, or audits. | `content` |
| UI/UX | Improves layout, responsiveness, accessibility, or interaction quality. | `ui`, `enhancement` |
| Refactor | Improves structure without changing intended behavior. | `refactor` |
| Testing | Adds or improves validation. | `testing` |
| Research/spike | Investigates an approach before implementation scope is known. | `research` |

Use labels that exist in the repository. If a useful label is missing, note it; do not make label changes part of the issue unless explicitly approved.

## Epics and child issues

Create an epic when the work affects multiple areas, needs phased delivery, changes standards across many files, expands a content area with many tasks, or would make one PR hard to review.

A good epic should include:

- [ ] overall outcome;
- [ ] why it matters;
- [ ] planned child issues or child themes;
- [ ] non-goals;
- [ ] safe implementation order;
- [ ] validation strategy.

When creating a child issue, link the epic near the top:

```md
Parent epic: #95
Refs #95
Part of #95
```

The child issue should stay executable on its own. Do not copy the full epic body into every child issue.

## Project-specific issue areas

Issues may touch:

- DSA learning tracks;
- System Design content;
- Java/backend content;
- visual walkthroughs;
- dashboard/progress surfaces;
- category/topic manifests;
- discovered production-ready problem files;
- content-profile and production-visibility logic;
- aptitude-test functionality.

Name the relevant area in the issue summary and references.

## Branch naming guidance

Use the repository branch naming style. Prefer approved prefixes such as `feature/`, `fix/`, `bugfix/`, `refactor/`, or another prefix already accepted by the project.

For documentation work in this repo, use the maintainer-approved feature-style prefix when requested, for example:

```text
feature/add-github-issue-authoring-guidelines
```

Do not use unsupported prefixes such as `docs/` when they are not part of the repo convention.

## Required issue sections

Each implementation-ready issue should include these sections.

### Title

A clear searchable title. Good: `Fix Random Practice all-categories selection getting stuck`. Poor: `Random bug`.

### Type / Labels

State the type and suggested labels. Example: `Type: Bug`; `Labels: bug, ui, testing`.

### Parent epic or related issue

Link parent epics or related work. Example: `Parent epic: #95`; `Related: #131, #143`.

### Summary

Explain the desired outcome in one or two short paragraphs.

### Problem / Motivation

Explain what is broken, missing, confusing, risky, or valuable to improve.

### User-facing outcome

Describe what learners, maintainers, or contributors should experience after completion.

### Required references

List docs, issues, PRs, and source files that must be read before implementation.

### Research notes

Record what was checked: open issues, closed issues, related PRs, docs, and source files.

### Suggested branch name

Use a short lowercase hyphenated branch with the correct repo prefix.

### Scope

List exactly what should be implemented.

### Files likely to create or edit

Separate files to create, files to edit, and files not to edit.

### Implementation requirements

State exact behavior, data rules, metadata expectations, UI behavior, compatibility needs, and sequencing.

### Content/design/quality requirements

Reinforce project standards:

- clear explanation-first content;
- no hardcoded misleading counts;
- no unrelated refactors;
- mobile-friendly UI;
- accessible reusable components;
- production-ready metadata where applicable;
- tests and build validation.

### Testing and validation

Use the relevant validation steps. Common commands:

```bash
npm run test:unit
npm run build
```

For docs-only work, verify Markdown rendering, internal paths, issue references, and that no unrelated source files changed.

### Acceptance criteria

Use observable checklist items. Good: `category: "all" is treated as no category filter.` Poor: `Make it better.`

### Non-goals

State what must not change.

### PR requirements

Require issue link, summary, files changed, validation performed, screenshots for UI changes when useful, skipped-test notes, and `Closes #<issue>` when complete.

### Done means

Define the final state after merge.

- <Documentation or validation complete>
- <No unrelated files changed>
```

## Good and poor examples

### Bug

Good: `Fix dashboard count mismatch with topic page problem totals`.

Why it works: it names the surface, the mismatch, and the expected source-of-truth concern.

Poor: `Dashboard numbers are wrong`.

Why it fails: it does not identify the data path, scope, or acceptance criteria.

### Content

Good: `Add anagram frequency-window coding problem for Sliding Window`.

Why it works: it names one topic, one concept, and one content deliverable.

Poor: `Add an anagram problem`.

Why it fails: it omits topic path, quality standard, visual expectation, metadata, and validation.

### UI/UX

Good: `Improve dashboard hero card large-screen layout`.

Why it works: it names the surface and viewport focus while leaving room for a small targeted UI change.

Poor: `Make dashboard prettier`.

Why it fails: it is subjective and has no acceptance criteria.

## Project standards checklist

Every issue should reinforce these standards when relevant:

- [ ] Learner-facing content is clear, practical, and explanation-first.
- [ ] New real content normally lives under `src/data/problems/**`.
- [ ] Production-visible content uses approved production metadata where applicable.
- [ ] Visual walkthroughs are config-driven and use existing renderers where possible.
- [ ] Counts and progress use reliable source-of-truth paths, not hardcoded values.
- [ ] UI changes remain mobile-friendly and accessible.
- [ ] Components are reusable where possible.
- [ ] Tests and build validation are requested when applicable.
- [ ] Skipped validation must be explained in the PR.
- [ ] Unrelated cleanup or refactors are explicitly out of scope.

## Useful prior issues

Reference prior work only when it helps implementers understand context.

- #95 — Production question bank quality epic.
- #131 — Explanation-first authoring standard.
- #135 — Focused DSA mastery problem task.
- #138 — Topic objectives, notes, and roadmap metadata task.
