# Adding New Problems

The question bank supports two sources of problems:

1. Existing legacy banks under `src/data/banks`.
2. New one-file-per-problem files under `src/data/problems`.

The preferred workflow for new content is:

1. Create a file under `src/data/problems/<category>/<topicId>/<problem-id>.js`.
2. Export a problem object as `export default problem` or `export const problem = { ... }`.
3. Add a config-driven `visualWalkthrough` whenever the question can reasonably benefit from showing state, movement, decisions, or transitions.
4. Run `npm run test:unit`.
5. Run `npm run build`.
6. Open the app and verify the problem appears under the expected topic.

## Folder structure

Use this structure for new problems:

```text
src/data/problems/system/scalability/url-shortener.js
src/data/problems/system/caching/cache-aside.js
src/data/problems/dsa/sliding-window/max-sum-subarray.js
```

The folder names should match the problem metadata:

- `category` should match a category from `categoryManifest`.
- `topicId` should match an existing topic in `topicManifest`.
- The topic's category should match the problem category.

## Required fields

Every problem should include:

```js
const problem = {
  id: 'unique-problem-id',
  type: 'multiple-choice',
  category: 'dsa',
  topicId: 'sliding-window',
  title: 'Clear problem title',
  difficulty: 'Easy',
  question: 'Problem statement'
};

export default problem;
```

`prompt` and `question` are compatibility aliases. You may provide either one. Normalization keeps both available so existing UI code continues to work.

## Visual walkthrough expectation

New questions should include a config-driven `visualWalkthrough` wherever possible.

This is especially expected when the learner benefits from seeing:

- how a window, pointer, index, cursor, or frontier moves;
- how state changes after each step;
- when an invariant becomes valid or invalid;
- how an answer is recorded or updated;
- how a DP table, graph traversal, stack, queue, heap, or frequency map evolves.

For DSA coding questions, the default expectation is: include a visual walkthrough unless there is a clear reason it would not help. If no visual is included, explain why in the PR notes.

A visual walkthrough is for mental pictures and state movement, not for repeating static algorithm instructions. Do not add extra `body` flow cards beside the visual that simply duplicate steps already covered by `stepByStepBreakdown`, `hints`, `intuition`, or `explanation`. For example, avoid cards like `Window update order` when the visual itself already shows what enters, what leaves, and when state matches.

Visuals must follow `docs/visual-schema.md`:

- use `visualWalkthrough` config in the problem file;
- use supported diagram types such as `array`, `grid`, `graph`, `table`, `timeline`, `cards`, `tree`, `heap`, or `state`;
- use ordered `frames` to show progression;
- use semantic `role` values instead of CSS classes;
- focus each frame on the changing state, movement, invariant, or decision point;
- do not add raw HTML or raw CSS;
- do not create one-off React renderers for a single problem;
- do not use static step cards as a substitute for a real visual walkthrough.

For Sliding Window problems, prefer:

```js
visualWalkthrough: {
  diagram: {
    type: 'array',
    variant: 'sliding-window',
    title: 'Sliding window walkthrough',
    description: 'Show what enters, what leaves, and how state changes.',
    values: [],
    legend: [],
    frames: []
  }
}
```

## Optional fields

Common optional fields include:

- `tags`
- `options`
- `answer`
- `explanation`
- `scoring`
- `metadata`
- `constraints`
- `hints`
- `visualWalkthrough`

Complex system design problems can also use existing rich fields:

- `scenario`
- `requirements`
- `expectedAnswerOutline`
- `scoringRubric`
- `scoringDictionary`
- `modelAnswer`
- `commonWeakAnswers`
- `finalPattern`

## Supported problem types

Supported types are registered in `src/problems/problemTypeRegistry.js`:

- `multiple-choice`
- `coding`
- `code`
- `simple-system-design`
- `complex-system-design`

Use `coding` for existing DSA-style coding questions because that is the current user-facing behavior. `code` is available as a normalized future-friendly alias.

## Discovery and loading

`src/problems/problemDiscovery.js` uses `import.meta.glob` to discover files under `src/data/problems/**/*.js`.

Each discovered problem is normalized, validated, and then merged into the matching topic by `questionBankService`.

Legacy bank files under `src/data/banks` are now compatibility fallbacks. If a discovered problem and a legacy bank question use the same `id`, the discovered problem wins and the legacy duplicate is skipped for that topic. This lets migration happen gradually without showing duplicate questions or breaking old topics that still rely on banks.

## Migrating legacy bank questions

Legacy banks are being phased out. New authored content should use `src/data/problems` only, while `src/data/banks` remains a temporary compatibility layer for topics that have not been migrated yet.

When migrating a topic:

1. Pick one source file: `src/data/banks/<category>/<topicId>.js`.
2. Create one file per question under `src/data/problems/<category>/<topicId>/<problem-id>.js`.
3. Preserve the original `id` exactly. Do not rename, prefix, suffix, slugify, or regenerate it because progress and completed status are keyed by ID.
4. Preserve existing authored fields unless a compatibility layer already normalizes them safely.
5. Add `category: '<category>'` if the legacy object did not already have it.
6. Preserve `topicId`; if missing, infer it from the legacy bank file name and add it explicitly.
7. Keep complex system design problems conservative: preserve scoring dictionaries, model answers, weak-answer examples, final patterns, and evaluation fields.
8. Preserve existing `visualWalkthrough` fields when present. When the migrated problem clearly benefits from a visual but does not have one, add a config-driven walkthrough instead of leaving a visual gap.
9. Leave the old bank file as a compatibility shell or fallback until tests prove it is safe to remove its questions.

A migrated problem should look like this:

```js
const problem = {
  id: 'scalability-001',
  type: 'system-design',
  category: 'system',
  topicId: 'scalability',
  title: 'Scale a URL Shortener',
  difficulty: 'Medium',
  question: 'Preserve the original question text and related fields.'
};

export default problem;
```

After migrating a topic, verify:

- `npm run test:unit` passes.
- `npm run build` passes.
- The topic still displays the same problem IDs.
- No duplicate IDs appear in the topic.
- `findQuestionById` can still locate migrated IDs.
- Completed and incomplete filters still match existing saved progress.
- Difficulty filters still work.
- Topic and progress counts remain correct.
- Complex system design rendering and scoring still work when the topic includes those problems.
- Existing or newly added visual walkthroughs render correctly and remain mobile-readable.

### Coding

```js
const problem = {
  id: 'sliding-window-longest-unique-001',
  type: 'coding',
  category: 'dsa',
  topicId: 'sliding-window',
  title: 'Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters',

  constraints: ['Input can be empty.', 'Characters may repeat many times.'],
  hints: ['Track the last seen position or a set for the active window.'],
  visualWalkthrough: {
    diagram: {
      type: 'array',
      variant: 'sliding-window',
      title: 'Unique-character window',
      description: 'The left pointer moves when a repeated character breaks the invariant.',
      values: ['a', 'b', 'c', 'a'],
      frames: [
        {
          title: 'Repeat found',
          activeRange: [0, 3],
          state: { label: 'Invariant', values: { repeated: 'a', action: 'move left' } },
          description: 'The second a breaks the unique-character invariant, so the window must be repaired.'
        }
      ]
    }
  }
};

export default problem;
```

## Adding a brand-new topic

1. Add a topic entry to `src/data/topicManifest.js`.
2. Set the topic `id`, `name`, `category`, and `description`.
3. Add one or more problem files under `src/data/problems/<category>/<topicId>/`.
4. Run `npm run test:unit`.
5. Open the category page and confirm the topic count is computed from loaded questions.

## Adding a brand-new problem type

1. Add the type to `src/problems/problemTypeRegistry.js`.
2. Provide a label and any type-specific normalization, validation, scorer, or component wiring.
3. Add validation and loading tests.
4. Add an authoring template if the type will be used regularly.

## Tests

Run:

```bash
npm run test:unit
npm run build
```

Prefer focused tests for normalization, validation, discovery, and service behavior instead of large snapshots.
