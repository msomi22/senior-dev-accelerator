# Production Question Quality Review

## Parent epic

Part of #95 — Epic: Expand production question bank with world-class clarity and intuition.

## Issue

#98 — Review existing production questions against clarity and learning-science guidelines.

## Review goal

Review current production-visible discovered questions against the #95 quality bar. This is documentation-only review work: no new production questions were added, and no production visibility was changed.

## Review method

Production-visible questions were identified under `src/data/problems/**` by looking for approved production metadata:

```js
metadata: {
  reviewStatus: 'approved',
  visibility: ['dev', 'prod']
}
```

Each question was reviewed against:

- clarity and intuition
- mental picture and visual understanding
- cognitive load control
- attention guidance
- practical developer usefulness
- misconception handling
- concrete-to-abstract explanation quality
- predict-before-reveal and self-explanation opportunities
- MCQ distractor quality where applicable
- DSA walkthrough quality where applicable
- System Design trade-off and production-reality quality where applicable

## Rating scale

| Rating | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Excellent | Already meets the production quality standard and needs no immediate improvement. |
| Good | Production-safe, useful, and clear, but could become more intuitive or visual. |
| Needs revision | Useful but has meaningful clarity, intuition, mental-picture, or learning-support gaps. |
| Not production-ready | Should be improved before being treated as high-quality production content. |

## Summary

Reviewed production-visible questions: **14**.

| Rating | Count |
|---|---:|
| Excellent | 2 |
| Good | 10 |
| Needs revision | 2 |
| Not production-ready | 0 |

Overall, the current production bank is technically safe and generally learner-friendly. The strongest content is the newer rich Java explanation and URL Shortener v2 content. The biggest cross-cutting gap is that many MCQs explain the correct answer but do not provide structured distractor explanations, predict-before-reveal prompts, or explicit self-explanation moments. The DSA wrapper questions are useful, but the current production DSA set needs more concrete trace support and step-frame walkthroughs to fully meet the #95 standard.

### Question ID: scalability-url-shortener-001

Title: Design a URL Shortener  
Category: system  
Topic: scalability  
Type: complex-system-design  
File: `src/data/problems/system/scalability/scalability-url-shortener-001.js`  
Current rating: Needs revision  
Priority: High

What works well:

- Broadly covers the right system design areas: APIs, mapping, collision handling, caching, analytics, scaling, security, reliability, and observability.
- Has a solid scoring rubric for interview-style evaluation.
- Technically safe enough for production, but not yet world-class as teaching content.

What is missing:

- It is a migrated legacy complex problem and is more rubric-heavy than learner-teaching-heavy.
- Needs richer body blocks, clearer architecture flow, and more concrete mental pictures.
- Duplicates the newer URL Shortener v2 topic area, which is stronger.

Recommended improvements:

- Prefer `scalability-url-shortener-v2` as the teaching reference.
- Either retire this older variant from production in a separate issue, or rewrite it into a distinct angle such as “URL shortener scoring drill.”
- Add architecture flow, read/write flows, cache-miss path, and analytics pipeline if kept.

Needs visual, animation, diagram, table, or step-frame support: Yes  
Suggested visual support: architecture flow, create/redirect flow, analytics async flow, bottleneck table.  
MCQ distractor explanation needed: Not applicable

### Question ID: scalability-url-shortener-v2

Title: Design a URL Shortener  
Category: system  
Topic: scalability  
Type: complex-system-design  
File: `src/data/problems/system/scalability/url-shortener-v2.js`  
Current rating: Good  
Priority: Medium

What works well:

- Strongest current system-design production item.
- Includes requirements, assumptions, APIs, data model, code generation, collision handling, redirect flow, analytics flow, scaling, abuse prevention, trade-offs, scoring rubric, and weak-answer guidance.
- Strong practical developer usefulness and production-reality coverage.

What is missing:

- Despite rich structured content, it still lacks an actual architecture diagram block with components and arrows.
- Could benefit from a learner-facing “predict the bottleneck” or “choose the trade-off” moment before revealing recommendations.

Recommended improvements:

- Add a top-level architecture diagram: Client/CDN -> Redirect Service -> Cache -> Mapping Store, plus Queue -> Analytics Workers -> Stats Store.
- Add one bottleneck/failure-mode table.
- Add predict-before-reveal prompts around 301 vs 302 and synchronous versus async analytics.

Needs visual, animation, diagram, table, or step-frame support: Yes  
Suggested visual support: full architecture diagram and bottleneck/failure-mode table.  
MCQ distractor explanation needed: Not applicable

## Common gaps found

1. **MCQ distractor explanations are the largest recurring gap.** Most MCQs explain why the correct answer is correct and mention why wrong answers are weak inside a paragraph, but they do not have structured, option-by-option distractor explanations.
2. **Predict-before-reveal moments are rare.** The content is explanatory, but learners are not often asked to make a small prediction before the explanation appears.
3. **Self-explanation prompts are underused.** Several questions have follow-up questions, but fewer ask the learner to restate the key mental model in their own words.
4. **Visual support is inconsistent.** The newer Java and DP content is strong visually, while several system-design MCQs would be much clearer with compact flow diagrams.
5. **Some migrated legacy wrappers are production-safe but less teachable.** `sliding-window-001` and `scalability-url-shortener-001` are useful, but they feel more like pattern/rubric prompts than polished learning experiences.
6. **Duplicate URL Shortener production coverage should be resolved deliberately.** The v2 version is much stronger as a teaching artifact; the older variant needs a distinct purpose or a visibility decision in a separate issue.

## Recommended follow-up issues

### High priority

1. **Improve DSA examples and visual walkthrough for `sliding-window-001`**
   - Add concrete numeric example, rolling-sum table, fixed-window step frames, and exact `O(n)` / `O(1)` explanation.

2. **Resolve duplicated URL Shortener production variants**
   - Decide whether `scalability-url-shortener-001` should be rewritten as a scoring drill, merged conceptually into v2, or made dev-only in a separate visibility-focused issue.

3. **Add structured MCQ distractor explanations across production MCQs**
   - Add option-by-option explanations for the six system MCQs and optionally the Java MCQs.

### Medium priority

4. **Add compact system-design visuals to production MCQs**
   - Rate limiting timeline.
   - Idempotency sequence diagram.
   - Cache-aside flow.
   - Queue retry/dead-letter flow.
   - Pub/sub fan-out diagram.
   - Multi-region consistency split-path diagram.

5. **Add visual and predict-before-reveal support to `java-core-hashmap-behavior-001`**
   - Bucket/collision walkthrough and mutable-key prediction prompt.

6. **Add hierarchy and scenario-prediction support to `java-core-checked-vs-unchecked-exceptions-001`**
   - Exception hierarchy diagram and checked/unchecked decision scenarios.

7. **Add architecture diagram and bottleneck table to `scalability-url-shortener-v2`**
   - Make the already-strong v2 problem more visually scannable.

### Low priority

8. **Add optional predict-before-reveal prompts to the strongest Java MCQs**
   - `equals() vs ==` and pass-by-value are already excellent; small interaction improvements would make them even stronger.

## Suggested priority order

1. Revise `sliding-window-001` because it is the clearest production DSA gap.
2. Decide what to do with duplicate URL Shortener variants.
3. Add structured distractor explanations for all production MCQs.
4. Add system-design visuals where they most improve mental models.
5. Polish the already-good Java learning items with diagrams and prediction prompts.
6. Add extra interaction polish to already-excellent Java MCQs only after higher-impact gaps are addressed.

## Validation

- Documentation-only change.
- No production content, visibility metadata, routing, UI, or service logic changed.
- Markdown structure reviewed for readability and clean rendering.

## Scope notes

This report completes the review and recommendation portion of #98. Follow-up implementation should happen in separate issues so this PR remains conservative and focused.
