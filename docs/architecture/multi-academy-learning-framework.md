# Multi-Academy Learning Framework Specification

## Document Status

This document defines the target architecture, product experience, extension model, and implementation standards for a reusable mobile-first learning platform.

The platform should support multiple academies from the same core system, including:

- CBC Academy for Grade 1–8 learners
- Tech Academy for developers
- CX Academy for customer experience training
- Future academies without core rewrites

The design goal is to make the system behave like a framework:

> Core engine stays stable. Academies, modules, themes, content, and selected components are added or overridden through configuration and extension points.

---

# 1. Vision

Build a world-class mobile-first learning framework that supports children, students, parents, teachers, and professional learners through a unified but customizable platform.

The platform must support:

- Grade-based learning
- Track-based learning
- Lessons
- Notes
- Roadmaps
- Lesson plans
- Teacher notes
- Student notes
- Topic practice
- Exams
- Results
- Progress tracking
- Read-aloud learning
- Visual walkthroughs
- Code walkthroughs
- Videos
- Rewards
- Badges
- Themes
- Academy-specific UI overrides

---

# 2. Design Principles

## 2.1 Mobile First

The system must be designed primarily for mobile users.

Requirements:

- Small screen optimized layouts
- Large tap targets
- Simple navigation
- Bottom navigation where useful
- Minimal scrolling on critical tasks
- Fast loading
- Offline-friendly where possible
- One-hand usage where possible

## 2.2 Few Clicks to Learning

The user should reach learning content quickly.

CBC example:

```text
Choose Grade
→ Choose Subject
→ Choose Learn / Practice / Exam
→ Start
```

Tech example:

```text
Choose Academy
→ Choose Track
→ Choose Topic
→ Learn / Practice / Visualize / Code
```

## 2.3 Framework First

The platform is not only a CBC app.

It is a reusable learning framework.

Academies should be added through configuration, module registration, content files, and optional overrides.

## 2.4 Configuration Before Custom Code

Prefer configuration over hardcoded logic.

Examples:

- Theme tokens
- Navigation labels
- Academy structure
- Module structure
- Reward rules
- Exam scoring rules
- Unlock rules

## 2.5 Core Stability

The core should not change every time a new academy, module, topic, or grade is added.

New learning experiences should be added through:

- Academy config
- Module config
- Content registry
- Theme config
- Optional overrides

# 28. Zero-Hardcoding Architecture

## 28.1 Principle

The platform should be designed so that business behavior, academy behavior, labels, navigation, themes, scoring, rewards, content, and feature availability are not hardcoded inside React components.

The React code should render and execute based on configuration, schemas, registries, and provider contracts.

## 28.2 What Must Not Be Hardcoded

The following must not be hardcoded in UI components:

- Academy names
- Grade names
- Subject names
- Track names
- Topic names
- Route labels
- Button labels
- Menu labels
- Theme colors
- Font sizes
- Card variants
- Exam scoring rules
- Star rules
- Badge unlock rules
- Celebration messages
- Feature flags
- Payment rules
- Language text
- Read-aloud settings
- Progress storage strategy
- Academy-specific layout behavior
- Content type labels

Bad example:

```tsx
<button>Start Grade 1 English</button>
```

Good example:

```tsx
<button>{t(action.labelKey)}</button>
```

Bad example:

```tsx
if (academy === "cbc") {
  showGrades();
}
```

Good example:

```tsx
renderNavigation(currentAcademy.navigationModel);
```

## 28.3 What Can Exist in Code

Code may contain:

- Generic rendering engines
- Generic routing engine
- Generic assessment engine
- Generic progress engine
- Generic speech interface
- Generic theme resolver
- Generic override resolver
- Type definitions
- Schema validation
- Utility functions
- Default fallback components

Code should not contain academy-specific business decisions unless it is inside an academy module or override.

# 29. Configuration-Driven System

## 29.1 Configuration Sources

The system should support configuration from:

- Local TypeScript config files
- JSON/YAML content files
- Remote backend config
- Feature flag service
- CMS or admin portal in future

## 29.2 Config Categories

The platform should define configs for:

```text
Academy Config
Module Config
Navigation Config
Theme Config
Localization Config
Feature Config
Reward Config
Assessment Config
Progress Config
Speech Config
Payment Config
Content Config
Route Config
```

## 29.3 Academy Config Example

```ts
export const academyConfig = {
  id: "cbc",
  nameKey: "academy.cbc.name",
  defaultLocale: "en",
  supportedLocales: ["en", "sw", "zh", "ru", "fr", "ar"],
  themeIds: ["cbc-light", "cbc-dark", "cbc-grade-1-cartoon"],
  navigationModel: "grade-subject-topic",
  modules: ["grade-1", "grade-2", "grade-3"],
  features: {
    readAloud: true,
    exams: true,
    badges: true,
    parentDashboard: true,
    teacherDashboard: true,
  },
};
```

## 29.4 Feature Config Example

```ts
export const featureConfig = {
  readAloud: {
    enabled: true,
    provider: "browser",
    highlightText: true,
    defaultRate: 0.85,
  },

  rewards: {
    stars: true,
    badges: true,
    confetti: true,
    cosmeticUnlocks: true,
  },

  videos: {
    enabled: true,
    providers: ["youtube", "cloudflare-stream", "self-hosted"],
  },
};
```

# 30. Overrideable Core Features

## 30.1 Principle

All core features should have default behavior, but academies should be able to override behavior when needed.

Core provides defaults.

Academy overrides customize experience.

## 30.2 Overrideable Features

Academies should be able to override:

- Layouts
- Cards
- Navigation
- Lesson renderer
- Quiz renderer
- Exam renderer
- Result screen
- Reward rules
- Badge rules
- Theme tokens
- Read-aloud behavior
- Progress strategy
- Payment strategy
- Content rendering
- Visualization rendering
- Dashboard widgets
- Parent dashboard sections
- Teacher dashboard sections

## 30.3 Override Contract

Override resolution:

```text
Module-specific override
→ Academy-specific override
→ Core default
```

Example:

```text
tech/dsa/dynamic-programming/overrides/VisualizationRenderer
→ tech/overrides/VisualizationRenderer
→ core/VisualizationRenderer
```

## 30.4 Provider-Based Overrides

Use provider interfaces for behavior.

Example:

```ts
export interface SpeechProvider {
  speak(input: SpeakInput): Promise<void>;
  pause(): void;
  resume(): void;
  stop(): void;
}
```

Academies can configure:

```ts
speechProvider: "browser"
speechProvider: "cloud"
speechProvider: "recorded-audio"
```

## 30.5 Engine-Based Overrides

Core engines should accept config, not hardcoded rules.

Example:

```ts
calculateStars(score, rewardConfig.starRules);
```

Not:

```ts
if (score > 90) return 5;
```

---

# 31. Internationalization and Localization

## 31.1 Principle

The platform must support global languages from the start.

The UI must not contain hardcoded visible strings.

All visible text should use translation keys.

Supported examples:

- English
- Kiswahili
- Chinese
- Russian
- French
- Arabic
- Spanish
- Portuguese
- Hindi

## 31.2 Language Switching

Users should be able to switch language globally.

Language may be determined by:

- User selection
- Browser language
- Academy default
- Parent/teacher preference

## 31.3 Localization Files

Example structure:

```text
src/
  i18n/
    locales/
      en/
        common.json
        cbc.json
        tech.json
        rewards.json
      sw/
        common.json
        cbc.json
        tech.json
        rewards.json
      zh/
        common.json
        cbc.json
        tech.json
        rewards.json
      ru/
        common.json
        cbc.json
        tech.json
        rewards.json
```

## 31.4 Translation Key Example

```json
{
  "common.start": "Start",
  "common.continue": "Continue",
  "rewards.congratulations": "Congratulations!",
  "cbc.grade1.english.title": "Grade 1 English",
  "tech.dsa.dynamicProgramming.title": "Dynamic Programming"
}
```

React usage:

```tsx
<h1>{t("cbc.grade1.english.title")}</h1>
<button>{t("common.start")}</button>
```

## 31.5 Right-to-Left Language Support

The platform should support RTL languages such as Arabic and Hebrew.

Theme/layout must support:

```text
direction: ltr
direction: rtl
```

Config example:

```ts
export const localeConfig = {
  locale: "ar",
  direction: "rtl",
};
```

## 31.6 Localized Content

Lessons, questions, exams, notes, and video metadata should support localization.

Example:

```ts
titleKey: "tech.dsa.dynamicProgramming.lesson1.title"
summaryKey: "tech.dsa.dynamicProgramming.lesson1.summary"
```

For full localized content:

```text
content/en/tech/dsa/dynamic-programming/
content/zh/tech/dsa/dynamic-programming/
content/ru/tech/dsa/dynamic-programming/
```

## 31.7 Read-Aloud Localization

Read-aloud must respect language and voice.

Example:

```ts
speech: {
  locale: "en-US",
  voicePreference: "child-friendly",
  rate: 0.85
}
```

For Chinese:

```ts
speech: {
  locale: "zh-CN",
  rate: 0.9
}
```

For Russian:

```ts
speech: {
  locale: "ru-RU",
  rate: 0.9
}
```

## 31.8 Localization Quality Rules

Translations should support:

- Different word lengths
- Different sentence structures
- Pluralization
- Date formats
- Number formats
- Directionality
- Voice availability
- Fallback language

Fallback example:

```text
zh-CN → zh → en
ru-RU → ru → en
```

# 32. Config-First Readiness Review

## Requirement: All system configs are never hardcoded

Supported after this update.

The document now explicitly defines configuration categories and forbids hardcoded system behavior inside UI components.

## Requirement: Nothing is hardcoded in code

Mostly supported with a practical clarification.

The correct target is:

> No business behavior, academy behavior, labels, content, theme values, scoring rules, reward rules, or feature behavior should be hardcoded in components.

Some generic framework logic must still exist in code, such as engines, validators, resolvers, and interfaces.

## Requirement: Purely config driven

Supported.

The platform should be config-driven through academy, module, theme, navigation, reward, speech, progress, assessment, and localization configs.

## Requirement: All core features can be overridden by specific academies

Supported.

The document now defines overrideable layouts, renderers, engines, providers, reward rules, progress behavior, speech behavior, and dashboard sections.

## Requirement: Switch to global languages like English, Chinese, Russian

Supported.

The document now includes internationalization, localization files, translation keys, RTL support, content localization, read-aloud localization, and fallback language strategy.

---

# 33. Final Architecture Rule

The final rule for implementation:

> If changing the experience requires editing a shared React component, the framework is not yet flexible enough.

A new academy, module, language, theme, reward model, or content type should be added through configuration, content files, registries, providers, or overrides.
