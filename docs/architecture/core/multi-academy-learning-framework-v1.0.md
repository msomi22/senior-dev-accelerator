# Multi-Academy Adaptive Learning Framework – Complete Specification

This document consolidates the original world‑class framework specification (sections 1–34) with all subsequent enhancements: adaptive learning models, production readiness metrics, and enterprise features.  
**No content has been removed** – only new sections have been added after the original section 34.

---

# Multi-Academy Learning Framework Specification (Original)

## Document Status

This document defines the target architecture, product experience, extension model, and implementation standards for a reusable mobile-first learning platform.

The platform should support multiple academies from the same core system, including:

- CBC Academy for Grade 1–8 learners
- Tech Academy for developers
- CX Academy for customer experience training
- Future academies without core rewrites

The design goal is to make the system behave like a framework:

> Core engine stays stable. Academies, modules, themes, content, and selected components are added or overridden through configuration and extension points.

---

# 1. Vision

Build a world-class mobile-first learning framework that supports children, students, parents, teachers, and professional learners through a unified but customizable platform.

The platform must support:

- Grade-based learning
- Track-based learning
- Lessons
- Notes
- Roadmaps
- Lesson plans
- Teacher notes
- Student notes
- Topic practice
- Exams
- Results
- Progress tracking
- Read-aloud learning
- Visual walkthroughs
- Code walkthroughs
- Videos
- Rewards
- Badges
- Themes
- Academy-specific UI overrides

---

# 2. Design Principles

## 2.1 Mobile First

The system must be designed primarily for mobile users.

Requirements:

- Small screen optimized layouts
- Large tap targets
- Simple navigation
- Bottom navigation where useful
- Minimal scrolling on critical tasks
- Fast loading
- Offline-friendly where possible
- One-hand usage where possible

## 2.2 Few Clicks to Learning

The user should reach learning content quickly.

CBC example:

```text
Choose Grade
→ Choose Subject
→ Choose Learn / Practice / Exam
→ Start
```

Tech example:

```text
Choose Academy
→ Choose Track
→ Choose Topic
→ Learn / Practice / Visualize / Code
```

## 2.3 Framework First

The platform is not only a CBC app.

It is a reusable learning framework.

Academies should be added through configuration, module registration, content files, and optional overrides.

## 2.4 Configuration Before Custom Code

Prefer configuration over hardcoded logic.

Examples:

- Theme tokens
- Navigation labels
- Academy structure
- Module structure
- Reward rules
- Exam scoring rules
- Unlock rules

## 2.5 Core Stability

The core should not change every time a new academy, module, topic, or grade is added.

New learning experiences should be added through:

- Academy config
- Module config
- Content registry
- Theme config
- Optional overrides

The platform should now be implemented as a reusable learning framework, with CBC, Tech, and CX added as academies on top of the shared core.

---

# 28. Zero-Hardcoding Architecture

## 28.1 Principle

The platform should be designed so that business behavior, academy behavior, labels, navigation, themes, scoring, rewards, content, and feature availability are not hardcoded inside React components.

The React code should render and execute based on configuration, schemas, registries, and provider contracts.

## 28.2 What Must Not Be Hardcoded

The following must not be hardcoded in UI components:

- Academy names
- Grade names
- Subject names
- Track names
- Topic names
- Route labels
- Button labels
- Menu labels
- Theme colors
- Font sizes
- Card variants
- Exam scoring rules
- Star rules
- Badge unlock rules
- Celebration messages
- Feature flags
- Payment rules
- Language text
- Read-aloud settings
- Progress storage strategy
- Academy-specific layout behavior
- Content type labels

Bad example:

```tsx
<button>Start Grade 1 English</button>
```

Good example:

```tsx
<button>{t(action.labelKey)}</button>
```

Bad example:

```tsx
if (academy === "cbc") {
  showGrades();
}
```

Good example:

```tsx
renderNavigation(currentAcademy.navigationModel);
```

## 28.3 What Can Exist in Code

Code may contain:

- Generic rendering engines
- Generic routing engine
- Generic assessment engine
- Generic progress engine
- Generic speech interface
- Generic theme resolver
- Generic override resolver
- Type definitions
- Schema validation
- Utility functions
- Default fallback components

Code should not contain academy-specific business decisions unless it is inside an academy module or override.

---

# 29. Configuration-Driven System

## 29.1 Configuration Sources

The system should support configuration from:

- Local TypeScript config files
- JSON/YAML content files
- Remote backend config
- Feature flag service
- CMS or admin portal in future

## 29.2 Config Categories

The platform should define configs for:

```text
Academy Config
Module Config
Navigation Config
Theme Config
Localization Config
Feature Config
Reward Config
Assessment Config
Progress Config
Speech Config
Payment Config
Content Config
Route Config
```

## 29.3 Academy Config Example

```ts
export const academyConfig = {
  id: "cbc",
  nameKey: "academy.cbc.name",
  defaultLocale: "en",
  supportedLocales: ["en", "sw", "zh", "ru", "fr", "ar"],
  themeIds: ["cbc-light", "cbc-dark", "cbc-grade-1-cartoon"],
  navigationModel: "grade-subject-topic",
  modules: ["grade-1", "grade-2", "grade-3"],
  features: {
    readAloud: true,
    exams: true,
    badges: true,
    parentDashboard: true,
    teacherDashboard: true,
  },
};
```

## 29.4 Feature Config Example

```ts
export const featureConfig = {
  readAloud: {
    enabled: true,
    provider: "browser",
    highlightText: true,
    defaultRate: 0.85,
  },

  rewards: {
    stars: true,
    badges: true,
    confetti: true,
    cosmeticUnlocks: true,
  },

  videos: {
    enabled: true,
    providers: ["youtube", "cloudflare-stream", "self-hosted"],
  },
};
```

# 30. Overrideable Core Features

## 30.1 Principle

All core features should have default behavior, but academies should be able to override behavior when needed.

Core provides defaults.

Academy overrides customize experience.

## 30.2 Overrideable Features

Academies should be able to override:

- Layouts
- Cards
- Navigation
- Lesson renderer
- Quiz renderer
- Exam renderer
- Result screen
- Reward rules
- Badge rules
- Theme tokens
- Read-aloud behavior
- Progress strategy
- Payment strategy
- Content rendering
- Visualization rendering
- Dashboard widgets
- Parent dashboard sections
- Teacher dashboard sections

## 30.3 Override Contract

Override resolution:

```text
Module-specific override
→ Academy-specific override
→ Core default
```

Example:

```text
tech/dsa/dynamic-programming/overrides/VisualizationRenderer
→ tech/overrides/VisualizationRenderer
→ core/VisualizationRenderer
```

## 30.4 Provider-Based Overrides

Use provider interfaces for behavior.

Example:

```ts
export interface SpeechProvider {
  speak(input: SpeakInput): Promise<void>;
  pause(): void;
  resume(): void;
  stop(): void;
}
```

Academies can configure:

```ts
speechProvider: "browser"
speechProvider: "cloud"
speechProvider: "recorded-audio"
```

## 30.5 Engine-Based Overrides

Core engines should accept config, not hardcoded rules.

Example:

```ts
calculateStars(score, rewardConfig.starRules);
```

Not:

```ts
if (score > 90) return 5;
```

---

# 31. Internationalization and Localization

## 31.1 Principle

The platform must support global languages from the start.

The UI must not contain hardcoded visible strings.

All visible text should use translation keys.

Supported examples:

- English
- Kiswahili
- Chinese
- Russian
- French
- Arabic
- Spanish
- Portuguese
- Hindi

## 31.2 Language Switching

Users should be able to switch language globally.

Language may be determined by:

- User selection
- Browser language
- Academy default
- Parent/teacher preference

## 31.3 Localization Files

Example structure:

```text
src/
  i18n/
    locales/
      en/
        common.json
        cbc.json
        tech.json
        rewards.json
      sw/
        common.json
        cbc.json
        tech.json
        rewards.json
      zh/
        common.json
        cbc.json
        tech.json
        rewards.json
      ru/
        common.json
        cbc.json
        tech.json
        rewards.json
```

## 31.4 Translation Key Example

```json
{
  "common.start": "Start",
  "common.continue": "Continue",
  "rewards.congratulations": "Congratulations!",
  "cbc.grade1.english.title": "Grade 1 English",
  "tech.dsa.dynamicProgramming.title": "Dynamic Programming"
}
```

React usage:

```tsx
<h1>{t("cbc.grade1.english.title")}</h1>
<button>{t("common.start")}</button>
```

## 31.5 Right-to-Left Language Support

The platform should support RTL languages such as Arabic and Hebrew.

Theme/layout must support:

```text
direction: ltr
direction: rtl
```

Config example:

```ts
export const localeConfig = {
  locale: "ar",
  direction: "rtl",
};
```

## 31.6 Localized Content

Lessons, questions, exams, notes, and video metadata should support localization.

Example:

```ts
titleKey: "tech.dsa.dynamicProgramming.lesson1.title"
summaryKey: "tech.dsa.dynamicProgramming.lesson1.summary"
```

For full localized content:

```text
content/en/tech/dsa/dynamic-programming/
content/zh/tech/dsa/dynamic-programming/
content/ru/tech/dsa/dynamic-programming/
```

## 31.7 Read-Aloud Localization

Read-aloud must respect language and voice.

Example:

```ts
speech: {
  locale: "en-US",
  voicePreference: "child-friendly",
  rate: 0.85
}
```

For Chinese:

```ts
speech: {
  locale: "zh-CN",
  rate: 0.9
}
```

For Russian:

```ts
speech: {
  locale: "ru-RU",
  rate: 0.9
}
```

## 31.8 Localization Quality Rules

Translations should support:

- Different word lengths
- Different sentence structures
- Pluralization
- Date formats
- Number formats
- Directionality
- Voice availability
- Fallback language

Fallback example:

```text
zh-CN → zh → en
ru-RU → ru → en
```

---

# 32. Config-First Readiness Review

## Requirement: All system configs are never hardcoded

Supported after this update.

The document now explicitly defines configuration categories and forbids hardcoded system behavior inside UI components.

## Requirement: Nothing is hardcoded in code

Mostly supported with a practical clarification.

The correct target is:

> No business behavior, academy behavior, labels, content, theme values, scoring rules, reward rules, or feature behavior should be hardcoded in components.

Some generic framework logic must still exist in code, such as engines, validators, resolvers, and interfaces.

## Requirement: Purely config driven

Supported.

The platform should be config-driven through academy, module, theme, navigation, reward, speech, progress, assessment, and localization configs.

## Requirement: All core features can be overridden by specific academies

Supported.

The document now defines overrideable layouts, renderers, engines, providers, reward rules, progress behavior, speech behavior, and dashboard sections.

## Requirement: Switch to global languages like English, Chinese, Russian

Supported.

The document now includes internationalization, localization files, translation keys, RTL support, content localization, read-aloud localization, and fallback language strategy.

---

# 33. Final Architecture Rule

The final rule for implementation:

> If changing the experience requires editing a shared React component, the framework is not yet flexible enough.

A new academy, module, language, theme, reward model, or content type should be added through configuration, content files, registries, providers, or overrides.

---

# 34. Multi-Domain and Tenant Resolution

## 34.1 Principle

The platform must support multiple domains and subdomains where each domain resolves to the correct academy, theme, navigation, modules, and content.

The same React application can serve many academies.

The academy is selected by a tenant resolver before rendering the app experience.

## 34.2 Example Domain Mapping

```text
cbc.academy.test.com  → CBC Academy
tech.academy.test.com → Tech Academy
cx.academy.test.com   → CX Academy
```

Expected behavior:

```text
Grade 1 learner visits cbc.academy.test.com
→ App resolves academyId = "cbc"
→ Loads CBC content
→ Shows CBC grades, subjects, lessons, quizzes, exams

IT student visits tech.academy.test.com
→ App resolves academyId = "tech"
→ Loads Tech content
→ Shows Tech tracks such as DSA, Backend, Frontend, Databases

Customer support specialist visits cx.academy.test.com
→ App resolves academyId = "cx"
→ Loads CX content
→ Shows CX modules such as Communication, Support Skills, Ticket Handling
```

## 34.3 Important Correction

Tech and CX domains should not land on CBC content.

They should land on their own academy content.

Correct mapping:

```text
cbc.academy.test.com  → CBC content
tech.academy.test.com → Tech content
cx.academy.test.com   → CX content
```

## 34.4 Tenant Resolver

The platform should include a tenant resolver.

Example:

```ts
export function resolveTenantFromHost(hostname: string): string {
  const mappings = {
    "cbc.academy.test.com": "cbc",
    "tech.academy.test.com": "tech",
    "cx.academy.test.com": "cx",
  };

  return mappings[hostname] ?? "default";
}
```

## 34.5 Runtime Boot Flow

Application boot sequence:

```text
1. Read current hostname
2. Resolve academyId from hostname
3. Load academy config
4. Load academy theme
5. Load academy navigation
6. Load academy modules
7. Load localization config
8. Load feature config
9. Render academy shell
```

## 34.6 Academy Host Config

Each academy should define allowed hosts.

Example:

```ts
export const cbcAcademyConfig = {
  id: "cbc",
  hosts: ["cbc.academy.test.com", "cbc.academy.qubitel.net"],
  defaultRoute: "/",
  modules: ["grade-1", "grade-2", "grade-3"],
};
```

Example:

```ts
export const techAcademyConfig = {
  id: "tech",
  hosts: ["tech.academy.test.com", "tech.academy.qubitel.net"],
  defaultRoute: "/",
  modules: ["dsa", "backend", "frontend", "databases"],
};
```

Example:

```ts
export const cxAcademyConfig = {
  id: "cx",
  hosts: ["cx.academy.test.com", "cx.academy.qubitel.net"],
  defaultRoute: "/",
  modules: ["communication", "support-skills", "ticket-handling"],
};
```

## 34.7 Fallback Behavior

If hostname is unknown:

```text
academy.test.com
→ Show academy selector

unknown.academy.test.com
→ Show not configured page or academy selector
```

Do not silently load CBC for unknown domains unless configured intentionally.

## 34.8 Local Development Support

Local development should support host-based testing.

Example `/etc/hosts` entries:

```text
127.0.0.1 cbc.academy.test.com
127.0.0.1 tech.academy.test.com
127.0.0.1 cx.academy.test.com
```

Dev server:

```text
http://cbc.academy.test.com:5173
http://tech.academy.test.com:5173
http://cx.academy.test.com:5173
```

## 34.9 Deployment Support

The deployment platform should route all academy domains to the same frontend application.

The frontend then resolves the correct academy from hostname.

Possible deployment model:

```text
Same React build
Same CDN/static hosting
Multiple domains/subdomains
Runtime academy resolution
```

## 34.10 Domain Resolution Readiness

Requirement: Grade 1 student uses `cbc.academy.test.com` and lands on CBC content.

Supported.

Requirement: IT student uses `tech.academy.test.com` and lands on Tech content.

Supported.

Requirement: Customer support specialist uses `cx.academy.test.com` and lands on CX content.

Supported.

The document now explicitly defines host-based tenant resolution.

# 35. Adaptive Learning & Learner Intelligence

This section defines the adaptive learning model that personalises the experience for every learner.

## 35.1 Learning Graph

```text
Academy
→ Module
→ Competency
→ Skill
→ Topic
→ Lesson
→ Activity
→ Assessment
```

## 35.2 Competency Schema

```ts
type Competency = {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  skills: Skill[];
}
```

## 35.3 Skill Schema

```ts
type Skill = {
  id: string;
  competencyId: string;
  masteryThreshold: number;
  topics: Topic[];
}
```

## 35.4 Mastery Model

Mastery levels (percentage score):

| Level | Range |
|-------|-------|
| Beginner | 0–39 |
| Developing | 40–59 |
| Competent | 60–79 |
| Strong | 80–94 |
| Mastered | 95–100 |

**Mastery achieved when ALL of the following are true:**
- Score ≥ 80% on the most recent assessment
- 3 consecutive successful attempts
- Retention score ≥ 70% after a review cycle (e.g., 7 days later)

## 35.5 Learner Intelligence Profile

```ts
type LearnerProfile = {
  strengths: string[];           // skills with mastery ≥ 80%
  weaknesses: string[];          // skills with mastery < 60%
  mastery: Record<string, number>;   // skill id → mastery %
  retention: Record<string, number>; // skill id → retention %
  learningVelocity: Record<string, string>; // e.g., "fast", "medium", "slow"
  interventionHistory: InterventionRecord[];
  recommendations: string[];
}
```

## 35.6 Recommendation Engine

Each content item (lesson, practice, exam) is scored using:

```text
recommendationScore =
  (masteryGap × 0.4) +
  (retentionRisk × 0.3) +
  (curriculumPriority × 0.2) +
  (recentPerformance × 0.1)
```

Where:
- `masteryGap` = target mastery (80) – current mastery (normalised 0–1)
- `retentionRisk` = predicted forgetting probability (higher for items not reviewed)
- `curriculumPriority` = configurable weight for core vs. extended content
- `recentPerformance` = 1 – (error rate on last 3 attempts)

## 35.7 Intervention Engine

Escalation rules (academy‑configurable thresholds):

```yaml
learner_intervention:
  condition: mastery < 40% for 3 consecutive attempts
  action: in‑app hint, simplified practice, extra scaffolding

parent_notification:
  condition: no measurable improvement after 2 weeks
  action: email/push notification with weak areas

teacher_intervention:
  condition: no improvement after 4 weeks
  action: teacher dashboard alert, suggested remediation plan
```

## 35.8 Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment

The platform automatically adjusts difficulty within academy‑defined bounds.

```yaml
rules:
  - after 2 consecutive failures: easier practice (one level down)
  - after 3 consecutive scores >= 90%: harder practice (one level up)

difficulty_range:
  min: "academy.config.difficulty.min"   # e.g., "beginner"
  max: "academy.config.difficulty.max"   # e.g., "advanced"
```

## 35.9 Strength & Weakness Detection

**Strength detection** identifies:
- Retained skills (mastery ≥ 80% and retention ≥ 75%)
- Fast‑learned skills (velocity = "fast")
- Consistently strong performance (last 5 attempts ≥ 85%)

**Weakness detection** identifies:
- Repeated mistakes (same question type wrong > 2 times)
- Forgotten concepts (retention drop > 30% from peak)
- Low mastery (< 60% after 3 attempts)

## 35.10 Catch‑Up Engine

For learners falling behind, the system automatically creates a **follow‑up plan**:

```text
Identify skill gaps (mastery < target)
→ Generate micro‑lessons and targeted practice
→ Set mastery goals (e.g., reach 70% within 5 sessions)
→ Escalate to parent/teacher if goals missed
```

# 36. Offline Engine & Sync

## 36.1 Storage Limits

| User type | Storage limit |
|-----------|---------------|
| Free | 50 MB (browser IndexedDB) |
| Paid | Configurable (default 200 MB) |

## 36.2 Conflict Resolution Strategy

Conflicts are resolved with the following priority (highest to lowest):

1. **Server authoritative** for identity, account status, enrolment
2. **Highest attempt timestamp** wins for progress updates
3. **Exam submissions are immutable** – once submitted, cannot be overwritten

## 36.3 Sync Retry Policy

```yaml
retry:
  strategy: exponential backoff
  intervals: [1000, 5000, 30000, 60000] ms
  max_retries: 5
  max_window: 24 hours
  after_max_window: queue stored, retry on next online event
```
