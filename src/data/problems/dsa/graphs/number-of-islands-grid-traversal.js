  title: 'Number of Islands — graph/grid traversal',
  difficulty: 'Medium',
  estimatedTime: '16 min',
  language: 'java',
  tags: ['graph', 'grid', 'dfs', 'bfs', 'interview-pattern', 'mental-model', 'visual-walkthrough', 'coding'],
  scenario: 'Given a grid of land and water, decide how many connected groups of land exist. A group may contain many land cells, but it should still count as one island if those cells touch up, down, left, or right.',
  question: 'Given grid rows 1100, 1001, 0011, return 2 because the top-left land group is one island and the right-side connected land group is another island.',
  examples: ['Input grid rows: 1100, 1001, 0011 -> Output: 2'],
  constraints: ['1 means land and 0 means water.', 'Only four-directional connection counts.', 'Each island should be counted once.'],
  starterThought: 'An island is not one land cell. It is a connected component of land cells.',
  intuition: 'Every land cell is a graph node. When scanning finds unvisited land, that is a new island. DFS or BFS then marks the whole connected island as visited.',
  mentalPicture: 'A map of land and water. When you step onto a new island, you walk across all connected land and mark your footprints.',
  patternSignal: 'Use graph traversal when neighboring cells form connected groups and you must avoid double-counting.',
  invariant: 'Every visited land cell already belongs to an island that has been counted.',
  bruteForceThought: 'Counting every land cell counts land size, not connected groups.',
  optimizationJourney: 'Count only the first unvisited land cell of a component. Traversal absorbs the rest of that island.',
  stepByStepBreakdown: ['Scan every cell from top-left to bottom-right.', 'When unvisited land is found, increment island count because this is the first cell of a new component.', 'Run DFS from that cell.', 'Mark all connected land as visited so it cannot start another island.', 'Continue scanning for the next unvisited land cell.'],
  finalPattern: 'Connected component traversal on a grid.',
  commonMistake: 'Counting each land cell instead of each connected group, or accidentally allowing diagonal connections.',
  commonMistakes: ['Missing bounds checks.', 'Forgetting to mark visited before recursion continues.', 'Using diagonal directions when only four directions are allowed.'],
  edgeCases: ['All water', 'All land', 'Single cell grid', 'Separate islands touching only diagonally'],
  complexityAnalysis: 'Time is O(rows * cols) because the scan touches every cell and DFS marks each land cell at most once. Space is O(rows * cols) in the worst case when one large island fills the grid and the recursion stack grows with it.',
  explanation: 'The scan treats each unvisited land cell as the possible start of a new connected component. When it reaches the top-left 1, the island count becomes 1 and DFS marks the connected cells at (0,0), (0,1), and (1,0). Those marked cells are skipped later. When the scan reaches the separate land at (1,3), the count becomes 2 and DFS marks the connected right-side group. The final answer is 2 because there are exactly two four-directionally connected land groups.',

  finalTakeaway: 'A grid problem often becomes a graph problem when neighboring cells are connected; count the first unvisited cell of each component, then mark the rest.',
