  title: 'Coin Change — dynamic programming state/transition',
  difficulty: 'Medium',
  estimatedTime: '17 min',
  language: 'java',
  tags: ['dynamic-programming', 'state-transition', 'arrays', 'interview-pattern', 'visual-walkthrough', 'coding'],
  scenario: 'Given coin denominations and a target amount, find the fewest coins needed to make that amount.',
  question: 'Given coins = [1, 2, 5] and amount = 11, return 3.',
  examples: ['coins = [1, 2, 5], amount = 11 -> 3'],
  constraints: ['Each coin can be used multiple times.', 'Return -1 if the amount cannot be made.'],
  starterThought: 'Treat each amount from 0 to 11 as its own smaller target. For each target amount, ask: what is the fewest number of coins needed to make exactly this amount?',
  intuition: 'Do not try to guess the full answer for 11 immediately. First build a table of trusted answers for smaller amounts. Once a smaller amount has a best answer saved, larger amounts can reuse it instead of solving that smaller amount again.',
  mentalPicture: 'Imagine a row of boxes from amount 0 to the target amount. Each box is a mini target. When a box is solved, its value becomes a trusted answer that later boxes can use.',
  patternSignal: 'Use DP when a large answer can be built from repeated smaller answers that should be saved.',
  invariant: 'After processing an amount, its dp cell stores the minimum number of coins currently known for that exact amount.',
  stepByStepBreakdown: ['Create one dp cell for every amount from 0 through 11.', 'Set dp[0] = 0 because amount 0 needs zero coins.', 'For each amount, try every coin that can fit.', 'Turn each valid coin into a candidate answer using the already-solved remaining amount.', 'Keep the smallest candidate in dp[amount].', 'Return dp[11] because 11 is the final target.'],
  bruteForceThought: 'Brute force keeps revisiting the same remaining amounts through different coin choices.',
  optimizationJourney: 'DP avoids that repetition by saving the best result for each amount once, then reusing it whenever a larger amount needs that smaller answer.',
  finalPattern: 'Bottom-up DP with state and transition.',
  commonMistake: 'Thinking dp[1], dp[2], and dp[3] mean progress toward 11. They are separate smaller target amounts, and each asks for the fewest coins needed to make that exact amount.',
  edgeCases: ['Amount zero', 'No valid combination', 'Coin larger than amount'],
  complexityAnalysis: 'Time is O(amount times number of coins). Space is O(amount).',
  explanation: 'For every amount a, try each coin as the last coin used. If the coin fits, the remaining amount is a - coin, so the candidate answer is dp[a - coin] + 1. The dp cell keeps the smallest valid candidate. If no candidate exists, the amount stays unreachable.',
  solutionCode: `import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int coinChange(int[] coins, int amount) {
        int limit = amount + 1;
        int[] dp = new int[amount + 1];
        Arrays.fill(dp, limit);
        dp[0] = 0;

        for (int a = 1; a <= amount; a++) {
            for (int coin : coins) {
                int prev = a - coin;
                if (prev >= 0 && dp[prev] != limit) {
                    dp[a] = Math.min(dp[a], dp[prev] + 1);
                }
            }
        }

        return dp[amount] == limit ? -1 : dp[amount];
    }
}`,

      content: 'What each dp cell means\nBecause the final target is 11, we create one smaller target for every amount from 0 up to 11. dp[4] means: what is the fewest number of coins needed to make exactly amount 4? The answer is 2, because 2 + 2 uses fewer coins than 1 + 1 + 1 + 1.\n\nWhy the final answer is 3\nWe need to make amount 11 using coins [1, 2, 5]. The optimal way is 5 + 5 + 1 = 11, which uses 3 coins. The problem asks for the fewest coins, so the answer is 3.\n\nWhy dynamic programming?\nLarger amounts can reuse answers from smaller amounts. For example, once we know dp[6] = 2 from 5 + 1, amount 11 can reuse that saved answer by adding one more 5-coin: dp[6] + 1 = 3.\n\nPattern signal\nUse DP when smaller saved answers build larger answers.'
