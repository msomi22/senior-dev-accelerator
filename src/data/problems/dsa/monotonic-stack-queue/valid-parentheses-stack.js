  scenario: 'Given a string of bracket characters, decide whether every opening bracket is closed in the correct order.',
  question: 'Given s = "({[]})", return true because every closing bracket matches the most recent unmatched opening bracket.',
  examples: ['s = "({[]})" -> true', 's = "([)]" -> false'],
  constraints: ['Only bracket characters are considered.', 'A closing bracket must match the most recent unmatched opening bracket.', 'The stack must be empty after the full scan.'],
  starterThought: 'The most recently opened bracket must be the first one closed.',
  intuition: 'Opening brackets wait to be closed, so push them onto a stack. When a closing bracket appears, it must match the top of the stack. Anything else means the nesting order is broken.',
  mentalPicture: 'Think of a stack of plates. A closing bracket can only remove the top plate, never one buried underneath.',
  patternSignal: 'Use a stack when nested work must close in reverse order.',
  invariant: 'The stack contains exactly the unmatched opening brackets, with the next required closing match on top.',
  bruteForceThought: 'Checking whether a matching opening bracket exists somewhere is not enough because the order of closing matters.',
  optimizationJourney: 'The stack stores unfinished openings in last-in-first-out order, exactly matching nested bracket rules.',
  stepByStepBreakdown: ['Scan the string from left to right.', 'Push every opening bracket.', 'For every closing bracket, first ensure the stack is not empty.', 'Pop the top opening and verify it matches the closing bracket.', 'After the scan, return true only if the stack is empty.'],
  finalPattern: 'Last-in-first-out matching.',
  commonMistake: 'Checking whether a closing bracket matches anything in the stack instead of only the top opening.',
  commonMistakes: ['Peeking or popping before checking whether the stack is empty.', 'Forgetting to reject leftover opening brackets.', 'Using contains instead of top-of-stack matching.'],
  edgeCases: ['Closing bracket appears first', 'Leftover openings at the end', 'Mixed bracket types', 'Empty string if allowed', 'Odd-length string'],
  complexityAnalysis: 'Time is O(n) because each character is processed once. Space is O(n) in the worst case when many openings wait to close.',
  explanation: 'For the sample, each opening bracket is pushed onto the stack until the innermost bracket appears on top. Each closing bracket then compares only with that top opening. ], }, and ) match [, {, and ( in reverse order, and the stack is empty at the end, so the string is valid.',
