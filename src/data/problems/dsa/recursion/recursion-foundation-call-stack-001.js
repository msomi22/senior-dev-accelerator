  explanation: 'This foundation question defines recursion as the gateway to advanced patterns. A learner should understand the three laws of recursion, the call stack mental model, the ordered practice ladder, and the Phase 0 readiness checklist before moving to Phase 1.',
  starterThought: 'Start with the base case, then ask how each call makes the problem smaller and what gets stored on the call stack.',
  hints: [
    'If you cannot trace factorial or Fibonacci on paper, do not rush to trees or backtracking yet.',
    'The base case prevents infinite recursion.',
    'The call stack explains why recursive calls pause and resume.'
