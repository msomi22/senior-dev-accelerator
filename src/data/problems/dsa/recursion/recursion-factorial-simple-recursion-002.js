  scenario: 'You are learning the first recursion exercise: factorial. Factorial means multiplying a number by every positive whole number below it.',
  question: 'Write a recursive Java method factorial(n) that returns n!. For example, factorial(5) should return 120 because 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1.',
  prompt: 'How does factorial(n) teach the base case, recursive case, and return unwinding in the simplest possible way?',
  examples: [
    'Input: n = 0 -> Output: 1 because 0! is defined as 1.',
    'Input: n = 1 -> Output: 1 because 1! = 1.',
    'Input: n = 3 -> Output: 6 because 3! = 3 * 2 * 1.',
    'Input: n = 5 -> Output: 120 because 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1.'
  ],
  constraints: [
    'n is a non-negative integer.',
    'Use recursion for this exercise.',
    'Assume n is small enough that the result fits in a long.'
  ],
  starterThought: 'Factorial has a natural smaller problem: n! = n * (n - 1)!. The smallest direct answer is 0! = 1 or 1! = 1.',
  intuition: 'Factorial is beginner-friendly because it has one clear job: multiply the current number by the factorial of the number just below it. To compute 5!, first find 4!, then multiply that answer by 5. This continues until the base case returns 1.',
  plainLanguageExplanation: 'The symbol n! is read as n factorial. It means multiply n by every whole number below it until 1. So 5! means 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120. Recursion works here because 5! can be written as 5 * 4!, and 4! can be written as 4 * 3!.',
  mentalPicture: 'See the whole picture first. Calls go down: fact(5) -> fact(4) -> fact(3) -> fact(2) -> fact(1). Then answers come back up: fact(1) = 1, fact(2) = 2, fact(3) = 6, fact(4) = 24, fact(5) = 120. Picture a stack of plates: each new call is pushed on top during descent, and each completed call is popped during return.',
  patternSignal: 'Use simple recursion when the problem can be expressed as the current value plus the same problem on a smaller input.',
  invariant: 'Every recursive call must reduce n, so the function eventually reaches n == 0 or n == 1.',
  bruteForceThought: 'An iterative loop can multiply from 1 to n, but this exercise is about learning how recursive calls pause and return.',
  optimizationJourney: 'There is no overlapping subproblem here, so memoization is unnecessary. The goal is to master the call stack before moving to harder recursion.',
  stepByStepBreakdown: [
    'Start with the bigger picture: calls go down, returns come back up.',
    'Draw the left column for CALL STACK (DESCENT): fact(5), fact(4), fact(3), fact(2), fact(1).',
    'Mark the bottom base case: return 1.',
    'Draw the right column for UNWINDING (RETURN): fact(1) = 1, fact(2) = 2 * fact(1) = 2, fact(3) = 3 * fact(2) = 6, fact(4) = 4 * fact(3) = 24, fact(5) = 5 * fact(4) = 120.',
    'Use the stack-of-plates mental model: push one call for each descent step.',
    'Then pop one call for each return step.',
    'Practice this paper trace until the downward and upward flow feels automatic.'
  ],
  finalPattern: 'Linear recursion with one smaller recursive call and one direct base case.',
  commonMistake: 'Forgetting the base case means the function never reaches the stopping answer.',
  commonMistakes: [
    'Using n * factorial(n) instead of n * factorial(n - 1).',
    'Returning 0 for factorial(0). The correct value is 1.',
    'Writing a base case that never gets reached.',
    'Trying to multiply while going down without understanding that the final result is built while returning.'
  ],
  edgeCases: [
    'n = 0 should return 1.',
    'n = 1 should return 1.',
    'Large n can exceed numeric limits or stack depth, but that is outside this beginner exercise.'
  ],
  complexityAnalysis: 'Time is O(n) because the function makes one recursive call for each value from n down to 1. Space is O(n) because each call waits on the call stack until the base case returns.',
  explanation: 'For fact(5), recursion first descends through smaller calls: fact(5), fact(4), fact(3), fact(2), and fact(1). That is the downward phase. Then the base case returns 1, and the solution unwinds upward: fact(2) uses the returned fact(1) value, fact(3) uses the returned fact(2) value, fact(4) uses the returned fact(3) value, and fact(5) uses the returned fact(4) value.',
  solutionCode: `class Solution {
    public long factorial(int n) {
        if (n == 0 || n == 1) {
            return 1;
        }

        return n * factorial(n - 1);
    }
}`,
  finalTakeaway: 'Factorial is the simplest recursion exercise: see the calls going down, see the answers coming back up, and connect both with the push/pop behavior of the call stack.',
  selfExplanationPrompt: 'Before reading the solution, draw fact(5) on paper exactly this way: left side for calls going down, right side for returns coming up, and a stack-of-plates note beside it for push and pop actions.',
  visualExplanation: 'Trace the example factorial(5). The method calls smaller factorials until fact(1), then returns upward to build 120.',
