    'If p is empty, return [] for this authored problem convention because there is no meaningful non-empty anagram window to report.',
    'The result indices must be returned in increasing order.'
  ],
  starterThought: 'Stage A used the same fixed-size slide with a rolling sum. Here the window still moves the same way, but the maintained state is a frequency table instead of one number.',
  intuition: 'An anagram of p must use exactly the same characters with exactly the same counts. The order does not matter: "cba" is an anagram of "abc" because both have one c, one b, and one a. That means every candidate in s must have length p.length(). Slide a fixed-size window across s. When a character enters from the right, increment its window count. If the window grows too large, the character at left leaves, so decrement its count and move left. Once the window has exactly p.length() characters, compare the window counts with the target counts from p. A match means the current left index is an answer.',
  mentalPicture: 'Picture a small tray that can hold exactly p.length() letters. The tray slides across s one position at a time. Each slide removes the oldest letter and adds the newest letter. If the tray contains the same letter counts as p, the tray spells an anagram even if the order is different.',
  patternSignal: 'Use this pattern when the prompt asks for permutations or anagrams inside a string and every valid answer must have the same length as the pattern.',
  invariant: 'After each iteration, the window frequency array describes exactly the characters in s[left..right]. Before checking for a match, the algorithm ensures the window length is exactly p.length().',
  bruteForceThought: 'A brute-force solution sorts every length-p substring and compares it with sorted p. That repeats O(k log k) sorting work for each candidate window and hides the simple outgoing/incoming update.',
  optimizationJourney: 'A fixed-size frequency window reuses the previous window. One character leaves, one character enters, and only two counts change. Comparing 26 lowercase counts is constant-size work, so the scan is effectively linear.',
  stepByStepBreakdown: [
    'If p is empty or p.length() is greater than s.length(), return an empty List.',
    'Build targetFreq from the characters in p.',
    'Keep windowFreq for the current window in s and start left at 0.',
    'Move right from 0 to s.length() - 1 and increment the count for s.charAt(right).',
    'If the current window length becomes greater than p.length(), decrement the count for s.charAt(left) and move left forward.',
    'When the window length equals p.length(), compare targetFreq and windowFreq.',
    'If the frequencies match, add left into the answer list.',
    'Continue sliding so overlapping answers, such as s = "abab" and p = "ab", are not missed.'

    'Only record left after the window is full and its counts match the target counts.'
  ],
  complexityAnalysis: 'Let n be s.length() and let alphabet be 26 for lowercase English letters. The loop visits each character once with right, and left only moves forward as characters leave the fixed-size window. Comparing two 26-length int arrays after each full window costs O(26), so the total time is O(n * 26), which is effectively O(n) for a fixed alphabet. Extra space is O(26) for the target and window frequency arrays, which is O(1) for lowercase English letters.',
  explanation: 'For s = "cbaebabacd" and p = "abc", the target count is a:1, b:1, c:1. The first full window "cba" has exactly the same counts, so index 0 is recorded. The window then slides one step: c leaves and e enters, producing "bae", whose counts do not match the target. The scan continues with the same fixed-size rule. Later, the window "bac" at indices 6..8 again has a:1, b:1, c:1, so index 6 is recorded. The final answer is [0, 6].',
