  question: prompt,
  scenario: 'You have already deployed KubeTasker with direct commands and then managed it with YAML files. Now slow down and understand what Kubernetes did behind the scenes when those actions became running Pods, Services, Endpoints, and DNS names.',
  starterThought: 'Architecture is easier when you follow one request from your terminal to the API server, then through control plane decisions, then down to the worker node that runs the Pod.',
  intuition: 'Kubernetes is a desired-state system. You describe what should exist. The control plane stores and compares that desired state. Worker nodes run the containers that make the state real.',
  mentalPicture: 'Think of Kubernetes as a coordinated operations office. kubectl sends the request, the API server receives it, etcd stores the official state, controllers and the scheduler react, and kubelets on worker nodes make the assigned work happen.',
  patternSignal: 'When a Kubernetes object exists but the app is not working, ask which part of the chain is broken: request, storage, reconciliation, scheduling, node execution, Service selection, DNS, or network path.',
  invariant: 'Every component reads or changes state through the API server. The API server is the coordination point, and etcd is the durable store behind it.',
  finalPattern: 'Step 3: Understand the architecture behind the KubeTasker workload and Service flow.',
  commonMistake: 'Do not memorize components as isolated definitions. Trace how a Deployment becomes ReplicaSet, Pod, node assignment, running container, Service endpoint, DNS name, and reachable application.',
  commonMistakes: [
    'Thinking kubectl talks directly to worker nodes.',
    'Thinking etcd runs application containers.',
    'Thinking the scheduler starts containers.',
    'Thinking a Service automatically works even when its selector does not match Pod labels.',
    'Thinking CoreDNS routes traffic instead of resolving Service names.',
    'Ignoring kubeconfig context and accidentally inspecting the wrong cluster or namespace.'
  ],
  edgeCases: [
    'A Deployment exists but no Pod is scheduled because resources or constraints prevent placement.',
    'A Pod is scheduled but not Running because image pull or container startup fails.',
    'A Service exists but Endpoints are empty because the selector does not match ready Pods.',
    'DNS resolves but the app still fails because the Service, NetworkPolicy, or application port is wrong.'
  ],
  complexityAnalysis: 'This is conceptual architecture complexity. The learner should be able to trace who receives a request, who stores desired state, who watches for changes, who reconciles differences, who schedules Pods, who runs containers, and who makes workloads reachable.',
  explanation: 'This lesson explains the Kubernetes architecture path behind work already practiced in earlier steps. It is not a command drill and does not repeat the YAML manifest practice. The focus is the flow from kubectl and local kubeconfig to the API server, etcd, controllers, scheduler, kubelet, runtime, Pod, Service, Endpoints, and CoreDNS.',
  stepByStepBreakdown: [
    'Start with the learner side: kubectl, local kubeconfig, and current context.',
    'Follow the request to the API server.',
    'Store desired state through etcd.',
    'Let controllers watch and reconcile desired state against actual state.',
    'Let the scheduler choose a node for unscheduled Pods.',
    'Let kubelet and the container runtime start containers on the worker node.',
    'Expose the workload through a Service and Endpoints.',
    'Resolve the Service name through CoreDNS.',
    'Use architecture clues to identify which part of the system is failing.'
  ],
  finalTakeaway: 'Kubernetes is not magic. It is a set of control loops around one source of truth. You submit desired state to the API server, Kubernetes stores it, controllers and nodes act on it, and you reason about failures by following the flow.',

    summary: 'Use these highlights while reading the image.',
