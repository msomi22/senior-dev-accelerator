      title: 'Better leadership mental model',
      content: 'A strong senior developer says: “Here is the goal, why it matters, what good looks like, what constraints matter, when we will check progress, and where you can ask for help.” That keeps ownership with the junior engineer without leaving them isolated.'
    },
    {
      type: 'section',
      title: 'Final takeaway',
      content: 'Good delegation balances trust, accountability, learning, and delivery quality. You do not take the work back, and you do not vanish. You create the conditions for someone else to own the work successfully.'
    }
  ],
  explanation: 'The delegation failed because ownership was handed over without enough context, success criteria, guardrails, or checkpoints. Good delegation is not micromanagement, but it is also not abandonment. The senior developer should explain the goal and constraints, agree on what good looks like, create review points that catch risk early, and stay available for support while letting the junior engineer make meaningful decisions.',
  starterThought: 'Ask what information and support the junior engineer needed before they could safely own the work.',
  hints: [
    'Delegation should transfer ownership, not confusion.',
    'A checkpoint is not micromanagement when it is used to detect risk early.',
    'The goal is both delivery and growth.'
