How can we make that easier going forward?”\n\nThis is better because it replaces vague criticism with specific behavior, observable evidence, production impact, and a practical next step.\n\nBad: “You’re careless and difficult to work with.”\n\nBetter: “A few recent changes introduced avoidable regressions because important edge cases were not validated before merge. I’d like us to improve the review and testing approach on risky paths so the team can trust deployments more consistently.”\n\nThis is better because it avoids attacking identity and focuses on testing behavior, regression risk, and team trust.\n\nBad: “Every review with you turns into an argument.”\n\nBetter: “I’ve noticed that review discussions sometimes become defensive before we fully explore the technical concern. I’d like us to focus first on understanding the risk and trade-offs before deciding whether feedback should be accepted or rejected.”\n\nThis is better because it names defensiveness as a discussion pattern while keeping the goal collaborative: understand the technical risk before deciding what to do.'

      title: 'Psychological safety is not avoiding standards',
      content: 'A common wrong mental model is that being direct means being harsh. Another wrong model is that constructive feedback means avoiding discomfort entirely. Neither is senior leadership. Psychological safety means people can hear difficult truths without being shamed or attacked. Accountability means the team still names missed standards, production impact, and needed improvement. Strong feedback holds both at the same time.'

  ],
  explanation: 'The senior engineer should avoid both vague softness and hostile directness. Good feedback should name specific observable behavior, explain the engineering impact, and ask for a concrete improvement. Instead of saying “you are careless” or “you need to communicate better,” the feedback should discuss what happened in recent PRs, what risk it created for rollback, testing, deployment confidence, or review quality, and what operating pattern should change next time. This preserves professionalism while still creating accountability.',
  starterThought: 'Ask whether the feedback names an observable behavior, explains impact, and gives a clear next step without attacking the person.',
  hints: [
    'Direct feedback does not need to be harsh.',
    'Constructive feedback can still be uncomfortable.',
    'Focus on behavior, impact, and future improvement rather than identity or frustration.'
