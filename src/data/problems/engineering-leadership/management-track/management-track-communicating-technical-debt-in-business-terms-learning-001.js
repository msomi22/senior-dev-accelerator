That increases delivery time and makes mistakes harder to catch. We have two options: make a narrow change now with extra testing, or spend two days separating the pricing logic so future pricing changes are safer and faster.”\n\nAll-or-nothing: “We need to pause feature work and clean this up first.”\n\nBetter: “I do not think we need a full cleanup before shipping. The highest-risk area is the checkout path. My recommendation is to protect that path with tests now, ship the feature, then schedule the larger cleanup after this release.”'

      content: 'A senior engineer does not treat technical debt as either invisible or catastrophic. The better model is to translate the debt into consequences, give stakeholders real options, and recommend a balanced path. Sometimes the right answer is to fix the debt now. Sometimes it is to contain the risk, ship carefully, and schedule deeper cleanup later. The leadership skill is making that trade-off visible and responsible.'

    }
  ],
  explanation: 'The senior developer should avoid using technical debt as a vague complaint or defaulting to a large cleanup request. A stronger response translates the technical problem into business-relevant impact: delivery speed, regression risk, incident likelihood, maintenance cost, onboarding friction, customer impact, or opportunity cost. Then it gives stakeholders options, such as fixing the risky part now, adding tests around the affected path, making a narrow change with extra review, scheduling cleanup after the release, or intentionally accepting the debt for a defined reason. This helps the team make a responsible trade-off instead of treating technical debt as either an engineering preference or an emergency.',
  starterThought: 'Ask whether the explanation connects the debt to concrete impact and gives practical options rather than only asking for cleanup.',
  hints: [
    'Stakeholders do not need every technical detail, but they do need the consequence of the technical constraint.',
    'Not all debt needs to be fixed immediately; the key is to distinguish urgent risk from general messiness.',
    'A strong recommendation explains options, trade-offs, and the smallest responsible step forward.'
