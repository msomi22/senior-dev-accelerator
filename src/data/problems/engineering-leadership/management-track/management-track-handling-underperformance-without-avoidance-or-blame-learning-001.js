    }
  ],
  explanation: 'The senior engineer or team lead should address the repeated pattern directly, but keep the conversation focused on observable behavior, impact, context, expectations, support, and follow-up. Avoiding the conversation allows the pattern to continue and can be unfair to the teammate and the team. Blame-focused language such as “you are unreliable” attacks identity and rarely creates a useful path forward. Fair accountability names the pattern, asks what is getting in the way, clarifies what needs to change, agrees on concrete next actions, and follows up consistently.',
  starterThought: 'Ask whether the response names the pattern clearly, avoids identity labels, understands context, and creates a concrete next step.',
  hints: [
    'A pattern should be discussed earlier than feels comfortable, before the team normalizes working around it.',
    'Specific examples are fairer and more useful than labels like unreliable or careless.',
    'Support and accountability belong together: understand what is getting in the way, then make expectations and follow-up clear.'
